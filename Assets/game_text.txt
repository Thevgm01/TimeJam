You wake up in a room. You have no idea how you got here. All you know is that you must escape.
[ROOM_1]
Looking around, you see a door on your left and a box in the corner of the room.
[MINOR_CHOICE, Open the door [GOTO DOOR_1], Open the box [GOTO 2]]

[DOOR_1]
You walk over to the door. It is made of wood and has a metal knob. It appears to be very old.
The handle is locked.
[MINOR_CHOICE, Turn away [GOTO ROOM_1], [SECRET KEY_1] Unlock it with the key [GOTO ROOM_2]]

[ROOM_2]
You walk through the old door and find yourself in a hallway. Old pictures are hanging on either side. They give you an uncomfortable feeling.
The hairs on the back of your neck stand up. You see eyes in the darkness.
[FATAL_CHOICE, Stay put [GOTO DEATH_1]]
