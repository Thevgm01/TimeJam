[START] You wake up in a room. You have no idea how you got here. All you know is that you must escape.
[ROOM1] Looking around, you see a door on your left and a box in the corner of the room.
[MINOR_CHOICE: Open the door [GOTO: DOOR1],Open the box [GOTO: BOX1]]

[DOOR1] You walk over to the door. It is made of wood and has a metal knob. It appears to be very old.
The handle is locked.
[MINOR_CHOICE: Turn away [GOTO: ROOM1], [SECRET: KEY1] Unlock it with the key [GOTO: ROOM2]]

[BOX1] You stoop down over the box. It has a simple latch mechanism. You open it up and see a rusty key inside.
[GET: KEY1]
[MINOR_CHOICE: Go to the door [GOTO: DOOR1]]

[ROOM2] You walk through the old door and find yourself in a hallway. Old pictures are hanging on either side. They give you an uncomfortable feeling.
[WOLF] The hairs on the back of your neck stand up. You see eyes in the darkness. The eyes move forward to reveal the form of a ferocious wolf.
There is a hatchet on the wall near the wolf. You could probably reach it, but you might be killed before you can get off a good swing.
[FATAL_CHOICE: Stay put [GOTO: DEATH1], Grab the hatchet [GOTO: GRAB_HATCHET], [TIME: HATCHET] Strike the wolf with your hatchet [GOTO:KILL_WOLF]]

[DEATH1] You remain stationary, frozen in fear. The wolf edges closer, closer still. Finally it jumps on you, and you're [BURN: TORN LIMB FROM LIMB].
[DEAD]

[DEATH2] You lunge forward and manage to grab onto the hatchet.
[GET: HATCHET]
The wolf lunges at you.
[FATAL_CHOICE: Swing desperately [GOTO: WOLF_DEATH_WITH_HATCHET, [TIME: HATCHET] Cower in fear [GOTO: WOLF_DEATH_WITHOUT_HATCHET]]

[WOLF_DEATH_WITH_HATCHET] As you feared, the wolf lunges upon you before you can get a swing off. It uses its mighty canines to bite into you. You are [BURN: DEVOURED] by the wolf.
However, you feel a strangeness. The final point where your free will mattered... could you have done something differently?
[DEAD]

[WOLF_DEATH_WITHOUT_HATCHET] You followed your instincts and sent your hatchet away. You pray that it made a difference to someone, somewhere.
[DEAD]

[KILL_WOLF] How did this hatchet appear in your hands? You don't know, but you choose not to let that stop you as you swing it into the unprepared wolf.
Your hatchet makes a forceful connection, and the wolf staggers away.
